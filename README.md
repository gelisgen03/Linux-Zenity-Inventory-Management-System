## **About the project**
Hello Everyone

* Today I will tell you about my linux shell project. Before I start, I would like to thank Prof. Dr. Turgay Bigin and Research Assistant Talha Koruk for their support in this project.
* This project aims to develop a simple inventory management system using Zenity tools. The system supports basic functions such as adding, listing, updating and deleting products with a user-friendly graphical interface. Additionally, features such as user and program management are also provided.
